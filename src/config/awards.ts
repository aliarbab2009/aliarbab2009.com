/**
 * Awards & recognition — surfaced in /about § Awards.
 *
 * Privacy hard-rule: avoid awards whose name identifies the
 * institution Ali attended (any prize whose title contains that
 * institution's name is disqualifying). Generic / regional / national
 * / international awards are fine.
 *
 * Each award gets a stable id, a year, an issuing org (kept generic
 * when possible), an optional `pending: true` flag for awards
 * awaiting confirmation/score-release, and a 1-line blurb.
 *
 * AP Scholar with Distinction REQUIRES 5+ exams averaging ≥3.5 with
 * 3+ scores ≥3. Ali sits 4 APs in May 2026 — at most "AP Scholar"
 * (the entry-level tier) qualifies. Verify before promoting.
 *
 * SEED VALUES below are placeholders — Ali should curate.
