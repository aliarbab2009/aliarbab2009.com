/**
 * Activities & leadership — surfaced in /about § Activities.

 * Privacy hard-rule: NO school name, NO specific club name that

 * describe the FUNCTION (what was actually done) not the
 * INSTITUTION (where it happened).
 *
 *   ✅ "Editor — student literary magazine, 2024-26"
 *   ❌ "Editor — The [REDACTED] Quill, [REDACTED city]"
 *
 * Categories group the table visually. Order within a category is
 * descending by `from` (newest first).
 *
 * SEED VALUES are placeholders — Ali should rewrite to reflect actual
 * activities. Each entry should have substance (a 1-line blurb that
 * reads as something concrete, not a résumé buzzword stack).
